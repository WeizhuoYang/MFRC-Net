# MFRC-Net: Multi-Scale Feature Residual Convolutional Neural Network for Motor Imagery Decording
This is the PyTorch implementation of the FBCNet architecture for EEG-BCI classification.
A 13K-parameter lightweight Multi-Scale Feature Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MFRC-Net) has been developed, employing temporal multi-scale and cross-domain spatial convolution blocks. This network achieves classification accuracies of 85.1% on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset and 69.3% on the SHU dataset, thus surpassing state-of-the-art models in EEG-based motor imagery decoding.
